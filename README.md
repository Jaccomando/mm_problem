# mm_problem

This repository concerns one of my favorite counting problems, which I'm here calling the "M&M Problem": Given a collection of M&M's distributed uniformly across a given number of colors, how many do I need to draw in order to make it likely that I will draw at least one of each color?

I attack this problem both analytically and via simulation.
